# Student Placement Predictor

This is a machine learning model built to predict whether a student will be placed in a job or not based on their IQ and CGPA. The model utilizes logistic regression to make predictions.

## Features

- **IQ**: The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of the student.
- **CGPA**: The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of the student.

## Logistic Regression
